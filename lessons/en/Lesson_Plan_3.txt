Lesson Plan 3:  Progressive Story Telling

A progressive story is when one person starts a story idea an everyone else in the group adds a part of the story to it until the story is complete.

To start this Flipsticks story, the teacher or a student should create a Flipsticks animation on the XO computer.  Together the class is going to write a story based on this animation.

Sit in a circle on the floor and watch the starter animation as a group.

The person who created the animation should tell the first part of the story, and explain who and where the character is.

The next student should share what would happen next in the story.  Just choose one simple action.  This story should be based on the picture and should follow what came before.

The next student should add do the story and so on.

Each idea should build off of the next.  The story needs to build up to a problem, a climax, and finally a solution.

One student should record this story on their XO laptop.

Now each person should work on a Flipsticks animation for their part of the story.

When everyone is done, have the group sit together again.

The person who wrote the story down for the group will read it out loud.

As their part comes up in the story, each person will show their animation to the group.
