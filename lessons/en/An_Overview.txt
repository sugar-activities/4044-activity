Flipsticks: Lesson Plans Overview

Flipsticks is a "keyframe animation" tool that lets you pose and program a stick figure to rotate, twist, turn, tumble, and dane.  It provides a fun context for learners (and beginning XO users) to explore basic functions of the XO laptop and to learn how to articulate many creative ideas.  You can save your Flipsticks animations to the Journal and share them with friends using the mesh network.  You can export the first pose as a picture, then use it in other creative projects.

Flipsticks can be integrated into many school subject areas such as creative writing, art, drama, geometry and computer programming.  Students can make Flipsticks figures that relate to a subject the class is studying, and share them with peers.  It helps you develop spatial and analytical thinking skills and to express ideas that you might not have words for yet.
